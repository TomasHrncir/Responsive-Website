# Responsive-Website
 My first project
I am junior UX Designer and most of the time, while I am designing something I have no idea, how the development will look like, how long it will take, or if my mockups are even realistic and can be turned into a code. These are the main reasons, I decided to build this website from scratch.

This is not the typical project showcase, it is more like my journey from knowing nothing about the code to creating a responsive website and I dare to say, that it could be used for your local pizza restaurant. With this project, I would like to express my curiosity about coding and my intentions to learn more.
